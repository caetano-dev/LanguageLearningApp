## Work in progress
A simple HTML progessive web app that gives you phrases in German to be translated into English.

Feel free to contribute and check the [TranslateFromJson Repository](https://github.com/drull1000/TranslateFromJson) in order to generate your own json files in case you want to work with different languages.

New features to be added soon!
